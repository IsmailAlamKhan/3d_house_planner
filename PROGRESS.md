# Progress

## Deviations
- (none yet)

## Prompt 1 — Project Setup & Architecture — DONE
- [x] Scaffold, scripts, folder structure, app shell, 3D + 2D canvases, i18n, docs, tests
Summary: Vite/React/TS app with responsive shell (drawers on narrow screens), working 2D/3D/Split switching, placeholder R3F scene and SVG grid, key-based i18n, unit + Playwright smoke tests.
Limitations: Initial bundle >500 kB (three.js); code-splitting can come later.

## Prompt 2 — Core Data Model, Store, Undo/Redo, Persistence — DONE
- [x] Zod schemas/types, integrity rules, ops, batch via `apply`, zundo store, IndexedDB autosave + project list, JSON import/export with migration hook, sample project, undo/redo UI + shortcuts, Levels panel
Summary: Full model with validated ops; one `apply` call = one undo step; sample duplex round-trips through JSON; project manager dialog (new/open/duplicate/rename/delete/import/export).
Limitations: no UI for deleting/reordering levels yet (ops for reorder exist); stair/column UI comes in later prompts.
